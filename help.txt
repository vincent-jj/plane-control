Objective
Controllers must route arriving and departing aircraft both safely and accurately. 

Safe Separation Standards
Your job is to ensure that aircraft are separated by either of the following criteria:
            Laterally — 3 miles
            Vertically — 1,000 feet 

Commands
All commands are in the format: PlaneID + Command + [Command String]

— Take off:  PlaneID t (note: departing aircraft must first be assigned an altitude)
— Landing:  PlaneID l [runway]
— Clearances: PlaneID c [command string] (it can be a runway, a station, an altitude, or a heading)

Command String format
— PlaneId: 3 letters and 2 digits AA000
— Stations: Letters and digit
— Runways: 2 digits and a letter (the two digits being the heading of the runway divided by 10)
— Height: 1/1000 of the wanted height) (2 for 2000 feet)
— Heading: 3 digits
— Speed: Number

Examples
— AR46 c 10
— AR46 t

— FR27 l 06R

— GE55 c AX42 (the plane goes toward the AX42 station)

— ZT67 c 12 (the plane climbs to 12000 feet)

— HY88 c 090 (the plane takes the heading to 90°)

— PM12 s 200
